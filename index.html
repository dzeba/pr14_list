        <p>The terms location and place in geography are used to identify a point or an area on the Earth's
            surface or elsewhere. The term location generally implies a higher degree of certainty than place, the
            latter often indicating an entity with an ambiguous boundary,
            relying more on human or social attributes of place identity and sense of place than on geometry.[1]</p>

        <p>Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time.
            In general definitions of music will include common elements such as pitch
            (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation),
            dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed
            the "color" of a musical sound).
            Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. </p>

        <p>In music, a note is the pitch and duration of a sound, and also its representation in
            musical notation (♪, ♩). A note can also represent a pitch class. Notes are the building blocks of much
            written music: discretizations of musical phenomena that facilitate performance, comprehension, and
            analysis.
